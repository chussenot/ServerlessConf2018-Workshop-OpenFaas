# OpenFaas in a Raspberry Pi Cluster - Workshop

_Learn how to build a Kubernetes Cluster with Raspberry Pis as servers and how to run OpenFaas though some practical use cases._

This content is designed for audience without any prior Raspberry Pi, Docker, Kubernetes and OpenFaas knowledge.  
It starts from the Raspberry Pis' settings with OpenFaas and goes to few real life scenarious.  
Thanks to Alex Ellis and to all contributors in the OpenFaas Community for their amazing work.

**Disclaimer:**  
We are working in a fast-changing environment so this Lab may need to be updated with each softwares' new version.  
You can subscribe to [Alex Ellis' blog](https://www.alexellis.io) to see the latest updates of OpenFaas.


## Objectives

Building a cluster with Raspberry Pis is an affordable way to build a supercomputer or to simulate a mesh network or a scalable infrastructure.  
After completing this workshop, you should be able to:
* Create your own serverless Lab with a Raspberry Pi Cluster, Docker, Kubernetes and OpenFaas,
* Understand the fundamentals of Faas,
* Learn how to apply these concepts on real world scenarii leveraging the power of Azure Services.


## Prerequisites

* 3 or more Raspberry Pi 2 or 3
* 3 or more power supply line for Raspberry Pi
* 3 or more micro SD Cards (16Go min., 32Go if you can - _Faster SD Cards are better_)
* 1 small routeur + ethernet cables if you do not want to use your own WiFi or if you do not have WiFi dongle with RPi2
* 1 HDMI screen + cable (optional)
* 1 wireless tiny keyboard with Touchpad mouse (optional)
* Own any Microsoft Azure subscription


## Overview of this workshop

This workshop contains XX chapters, the first XX chapters will cover the material settings and the last ones will present some samples so you can understand different ways to interact with your local Serverless Lab or with a public cloud.
